### Howdy Raidn,

First of all, I would like to confirm that all the tasks mentioned in task description has been successfully completed.  
  
For the backend, I have used Laravel (obviously!) and it's advanced features, such as factories, request, resource, collection, console command, validation, CRUD, api routes and more.   
  
The frontend stack contains Vue, Vuex, Vue Router, Vue-Bootstrap, Webpack, Scss and Bootstrap. 

  
  
**Approch**

Whenever I get to work with a laravel project, my approach is to setup the db, local enviornment and start working on building datatbase relationships using models, migration and seed some fake data. Then I would generate the routes and perform CRUD using Postman.  
  
Once I'm satisfied with the backend, I would start scaffolding the frontend and install required dependencies. Once the structure is ready, I would start making api calls to backend to fetch respective data. In the end, once everything is implemented, I would work on designing.

\*As this was a fairly simple and small test, I haven't performed tests and authentication as it wasn't mentioned in the task description. Design is also fairly simple. I could add a lot of interesting stuff but for this test I'm keeping it task oriented.\*  


**Steps to run project**

*   Clone the repo
*   Setup .env file with correct DB details
*   Run 'php artisan migrate:fresh --seed' for fake data
*   Run 'npm install' and 'composer install' to install all dependencies
*   Run 'php artisan key:generate' to generate key
*   Run 'php artisan serve' and 'npm run watch'
*   You can use the browser to test the functionality
*   Run 'php artisan card:type' which is a custom command to check the card type. The card number input is secured, so you won't be able to see number while entering. 

**Any doubts?**

Feel free to contact me if you have any doubts. This was just a test so I haven't implemeted a lot of advanced stuff but if you want to check out what I'm capable of, please check this [repo](https://github.com/jay10596/Facebook-Plus). It's a facebook clone I made a couple of years ago. Also feel free to visit my [portfolio](https://jay-webdev.com/) to know more about my skillset.

Looking forward for a positive feedback.   
Cheers,
